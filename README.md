## Structure

 * `data`: Folder that holds the input dataset files, already in OPF file format;
 * `outputs`: Folder that holds the output files, such as `.npy`, `.pkl` and `.txt`;
 * `utils`
   * `loader.py`: Utility to load datasets and split them into training, validation and testing sets.

## Package Guidelines

### Installation

Install all the pre-needed requirements using:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data configuration

Please [download](https://www.recogna.tech/files/opf_distance/data.tar.gz) the datasets in the OPF file format and then put them on a `data/` folder.

## Usage

### Classify with Optimum-Path Forest

The first step is to classify the data using an OPF-based classifier with a particular distance measure. To accomplish such a step, one needs to use the following script:

```Python
python classify_with_opf.py -h
```

*Note that `-h` invokes the script helper, which assists users in employing the appropriate parameters.*

### Process Classification Report

After conducting the classification task, one needs to process its report into readable outputs. Please, use the following script to accomplish such a procedure:

```Python
python process_report.py -h
```

*Note that this script converts the .pkl reports into readable .txt outputs.*

### (Optinal) Plot Confusion Matrix

After performing the classification task, there is an optinal script that allows to plot its confusion matrix. Please, use the following script to accomplish such a procedure:

```Python
python plot_confusion_matrix.py -h
```

### Bash Script

Instead of invoking every script to conduct the experiments, it is also possible to use the provided shell script, as follows:

```Bash
./pipeline.sh
```

Such a script will conduct every step needed to accomplish the experimentation used throughout this paper. Furthermore, one can change any input argument that is defined in the script.
